# Guitar Rig 5 unfocused mode launcher

This small executable acts as a launcher for Guitar Rig 5.
It runs minimized in system tray and automatically closes when GR5 closes.
Right click on tray icon shows a menu which allows you to toggle unfocusable mode, set GR5 location, exit the application (exiting this way will also close GR5).
When executed for the fist time, it will ask for Guitar Rig executable location.

Note: Guitar Rig menus won't work when in unfocusable mode, but the rest of the controls will work correctly.
